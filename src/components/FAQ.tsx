const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What crops and diseases does it cover?",
    a: "Five crops today — corn, soybean, wheat, rice, and tomato — across 25 diseases plus a healthy baseline. Each crop has its own set of conditions the model was trained to tell apart.",
  },
  {
    q: "How accurate is it?",
    a: "Mean validation accuracy is around 96% across the measured crops, on held-out test images. Real-world accuracy depends on the crop and photo quality, so every diagnosis shows a confidence score — treat low-confidence results with caution.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does it work offline?",
    a: "Yes. The model is compact enough to run on-device, so it diagnoses without a connection and without sending your photos anywhere.",
  },
  {
    q: "What should I photograph?",
    a: "A single affected leaf, filling the frame, in good light. If no leaf is detected the app asks you to retake — clear, close, one leaf.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it free and open source?",
    a: "Yes — the full stack, model included, is open source on GitHub. You can run it yourself or try the hosted scanner.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is the model trained?",
    a: "An EfficientNet image classifier per crop, exported to TensorFlow Lite for on-device use, trained on labeled leaf-disease image sets and validated on held-out data.",
  },
